      Provide information that others may use to re-produce this behavior.
      For example:
      
      - A self-contained command to reproduce the error, e.g.
        ```console
        printf -- '- item A\n  - item A.a\n- item B' | pipx run mdformat -
        ```
      - Minimal content of a file that when formatted causes the error. Command to format the file.

      1. Create a file test.md with the content '...'
      2. Run `mdformat test.md`

        ```
      - The version of Python you're using.
      - Your operating system
