</div>

<!-- start mini-description -->

Mdformat is an opinionated Markdown formatter
that can be used to enforce a consistent style in Markdown files.
Mdformat is a Unix-style command-line tool as well as a Python library.

<!-- end mini-description -->

Find out more in the [docs](https://mdformat.readthedocs.io).

<!-- start installing -->

## Installing

Install with [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/) support:

```bash
pipx install mdformat
```

Install with [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) support:

```bash
pipx install mdformat
pipx inject mdformat mdformat-gfm
```

Note that GitHub's Markdown renderer supports syntax extensions not included in the GFM specification.
For full GitHub support do:

```bash
pipx install mdformat
pipx inject mdformat mdformat-gfm mdformat-frontmatter mdformat-footnote mdformat-gfm-alerts
```

Install with [Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax.html) support:

```bash
pipx install mdformat

```

<!-- end installing -->

<!-- start cli-usage -->

## Command line usage

### Format files

Format files `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in place

```bash
mdformat README.md CHANGELOG.md
```

Format `.md` files in current working directory recursively

```bash
mdformat .
```

Read Markdown from standard input until `EOF`.
Write formatted Markdown to standard output.

```bash
mdformat -
```

### Check formatting

```bash
mdformat --check README.md CHANGELOG.md
```

This will not apply any changes to the files.
If a file is not properly formatted, the exit code will be non-zero.

### Options

```console
foo@bar:~$ mdformat --help
usage: mdformat [-h] [--check] [--version] [--number] [--wrap {keep,no,INTEGER}]
                [--end-of-line {lf,crlf,keep}] [--exclude PATTERN]
                [--extensions EXTENSION] [--codeformatters LANGUAGE]
                [paths ...]

CommonMark compliant Markdown formatter

positional arguments:
  paths                 files to format

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --check               do not apply changes to files
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --number              apply consecutive numbering to ordered lists
  --wrap {keep,no,INTEGER}
                        paragraph word wrap mode (default: keep)
  --end-of-line {lf,crlf,keep}
                        output file line ending mode (default: lf)
  --exclude PATTERN     exclude files that match the Unix-style glob pattern (multiple allowed)
  --extensions EXTENSION
                        require and enable an extension plugin (multiple allowed) (use
                        `--no-extensions` to disable) (default: all enabled)
  --codeformatters LANGUAGE
                        require and enable a code formatter plugin (multiple allowed)
                        (use `--no-codeformatters` to disable) (default: all enabled)
```

The `--exclude` option is only available on Python 3.13+.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does mdformat backslash escape special syntax specific to MkDocs / Hugo / Obsidian / GitHub / some other Markdown engine?

Mdformat is a CommonMark formatter.
It doesn't have out-of-the-box support for syntax other than what is defined in [the CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/).

The custom syntax that these Markdown engines introduce typically redefines the meaning of
angle brackets, square brackets, parentheses, hash character — characters that are special in CommonMark.
Mdformat often resorts to backslash escaping these characters to ensure its formatting changes never alter a rendered document.

Additionally some engines, namely MkDocs,
[do not support](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1835) CommonMark to begin with,
so incompatibilities are unavoidable.

Luckily mdformat is extensible by plugins.
For many Markdown engines you'll find support by searching
[the plugin docs](https://mdformat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/plugins.html)
or [mdformat GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/mdformat).

You may also want to consider a documentation generator that adheres to CommonMark as its base syntax
e.g. [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)
or [Sphinx with Markdown](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html).

### Why not use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) instead?

Mdformat is pure Python code!
Python is pre-installed on macOS and virtually any Linux distribution,
meaning that typically little to no additional installations are required to run mdformat.
This argument also holds true when using together with
[pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) (also Python).
Prettier on the other hand requires Node.js/npm.

Prettier suffers from
[numerous](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Alang%3Amarkdown+label%3Atype%3Abug+)
bugs,
many of which cause changes in Markdown AST and rendered HTML.
Many of these bugs are a consequence of using
[`remark-parse`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-parse)
v8.x as Markdown parser which,
according to the author themselves,
is [inferior to markdown-it](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/issues/75#issuecomment-143532326) used by mdformat.
`remark-parse` v9.x is advertised as CommonMark compliant
and presumably would fix many of the issues,
but is not used by Prettier (v3.3.3) yet.

Prettier (v3.3.3), being able to format many languages other than Markdown,
is a large package with 73 direct dependencies
(mdformat only has one in Python 3.11+).
This can be a disadvantage in many environments,
one example being size optimized Docker images.

Mdformat's parser extension plugin API allows not only customization of the Markdown specification in use,
but also advanced features like [automatic table of contents generation](https://github.com/hukkin/mdformat-toc).
Also provided is a code formatter plugin API enabling integration of embedded code formatting for any programming language.

### What's wrong with the mdformat logo? It renders incorrectly and is just terrible in general.

Nope, the logo is actually pretty great – you're terrible.
The logo is more a piece of art than a logo anyways,
depicting the horrors of poorly formatted text documents.
I made it myself!

That said, if you have any graphic design skills and want to contribute a revised version, a PR is more than welcome 😄.
