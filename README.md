## Command line usage

### Format files

Format files `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in place

```bash

```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) instead?

Mdformat is pure Python code!
Python and pip are pre-installed on virtually any Linux distribution,
and Python is pre-installed on macOS, meaning that typically little to no additional installations are required to run mdformat.
Prettier requires Node.js/npm. This argument also holds true when using together with [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) (also Python).

Prettier suffers from [numerous](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Alang%3Amarkdown+label%3Atype%3Abug+) bugs,
many of which cause changes in Markdown AST and rendered HTML.
Many of these bugs are a consequence of using [`remark-parse`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-parse) v8.x as Markdown parser which,
according to the author themselves,
is [inferior to markdown-it](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/issues/75#issuecomment-143532326) used by mdformat.
`remark-parse` v9.x is advertised as CommonMark compliant and presumably would fix many of the issues, but is not used by Prettier yet (Prettier being at v2.2.1 at the time of writing).

Mdformat's parser extension plugin API allows not only customization of the Markdown specification in use,
but also advanced features like [automatic table of contents generation](https://github.com/hukkinj1/mdformat-toc).
The code formatter plugin API enables integration of embedded code formatting for any programming language.

### What's wrong with the mdformat logo? It renders incorrectly and is just terrible in general.

Nope, the logo is actually pretty great â€“ you're terrible.
The logo is more a piece of art than a logo anyways,
depicting the horrors of poorly formatted text documents.
I made it myself!

That said, if you have any graphic design skills and want to contribute a revised version, a PR is more than welcome ðŸ˜„.
