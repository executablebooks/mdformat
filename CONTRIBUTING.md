# Contributing

Welcome to the `mdformat` repository!
We're excited you're here and want to contribute. âœ¨

Below are the basic development steps, and for further information also see the [EPB organisation guidelines](<https://github.com/executablebooks/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>).

1. Fork and clone the repository.

1. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

1. Install pre-commit hooks

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

1. After making changes and having written tests, make sure tests pass:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   Alternatively you can run the tests *via* `tox`,
   which will automate the poetry install into a virtual environment, before calling pytest.

1. Test the pre-commit hook against the repository

   ```bash
   pre-commit try-repo . mdformat --verbose --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
   ```

1. Commit, push, and make a PR.

## Developing code formatter plugins

Mdformat code formatter plugins need to define a formatter function that is of type `Callable[[str, str], str]`.
The input arguments are the code block's unformatted code and info string, in that order.
The return value should be formatted code.

This function needs to be exposed via entry point distribution metadata.
The entry point's group must be "mdformat.codeformatter",
name must be name of the coding language it formats (as it appears in Markdown code block info strings), e.g. "python",
and value has to point to the formatter function within the plugin package,
e.g. "my\_package.some\_module:format\_python"

If using `setup.py` for packaging, the entry point configuration would have to be similar to:

```python
import setuptools

setuptools.setup(
    # other arguments here...
    entry_points={
        "mdformat.codeformatter": ["python = my_package.some_module:format_python"]
    }
)
```

If using Poetry for packaging, the entry point configuration in `pyproject.toml` would need to be like:

```toml
# other config here...
[tool.poetry.plugins."mdformat.codeformatter"]
"python" = "my_package.some_module:format_python"
```

For a real-world example plugin, see [mdformat-black](<https://github.com/hukkinj1/mdformat-black>),
which formats Python code blocks with Black.

## Developing parser extension plugins

The easiest way to get started on a plugin, is to use the <https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat-plugin> template repository.

Mdformat parser extension plugins need to adhere to the `mdformat.plugins.ParserExtensionInterface`:

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from markdown_it import MarkdownIt
from markdown_it.token import Token
from mdformat.renderer import MDRenderer


def update_mdit(mdit: MarkdownIt) -> None:
   """Update the parser, e.g. by adding a plugin: `mdit.use(myplugin)`"""
   pass


def render_token(
   renderer: MDRenderer,
   tokens: List[Token],
   index: int,
   options: dict,
   env: dict,
) -> Optional[Tuple[str, int]]:
   """Convert token(s) to a string, or return None if no render method
   available.

   :returns: (text, index) where index is of the final "consumed" token
   """
   return None
```

This function needs to be exposed via entry point distribution metadata.
and the entry point's group must be "mdformat.parser\_extension".

If using `setup.py` for packaging, the entry point configuration would have to be similar to:

```python
import setuptools

setuptools.setup(
    # other arguments here...
    entry_points={
        "mdformat.parser_extension": ["myextension = my_package:ext_module_or_class"]
    }
)
```

If using Poetry or Flit for packaging, the entry point configuration in `pyproject.toml` would need to be like:

```toml
# other config here...
[tool.poetry.plugins."mdformat.parser_extension"]
"myextension" = "my_package:ext_module_or_class"
# or
[tool.flit.plugins."mdformat.parser_extension"]
"myextension" = "my_package:ext_module_or_class"
```
